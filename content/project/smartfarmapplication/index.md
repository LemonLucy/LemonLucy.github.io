summary: 

  <System Overview>

  ● Robot System
  - Image Collection: A camera mounted on the mobile robot captures images of the crops.
  - Image Processing: Captured images are sent to deep learning models (AI Hub's "Field Crop Pest Diagnosis Image API" and the Rural Development Administration's "Crop Pest Search Service") to determine pest infestation.
  - Model: The API analyzes whether the crop is infested and returns the type of pest causing the damage. The deep learning model classifies and diagnoses the pest type and determines the appropriate pesticide application.
  - Spray Module: An automatic pesticide spray system targets areas where pests are detected.
  - Communication Module: Facilitates data exchange between the robot and the app using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
  - Sensors: Various sensors such as GPS and distance sensors detect crop location and pest status.

  ● Deep Learning Model Server
  - Model Deployment: The trained model in Python is converted to TFLite for deployment on the robot or deployed on a server.
  - Prediction Processing: The robot sends captured images to the model server for pest analysis and receives results.

  ● Remote Control App
  - UI/UX: Provides a user interface for controlling the robot and monitoring real-time status.
  - Real-time Data Communication: The app receives status updates and analysis results from the robot.
  - Control Features: Allows users to manually move the robot and issue pesticide spraying commands.
