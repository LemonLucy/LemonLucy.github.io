title: Real-Time Locker Management
summary: This project is a server program that allows up to 5 clients to simultaneously manage lockers. A total of 10 lockers are available, with each locker capable of storing up to 5 items. Clients can protect their lockers with passwords and have the ability to add or remove items, reset passwords, and manage locker information. The project was developed independently and includes the following key components are server development (socket creation, client management, and handling multiple connections), locker management (initialization, item management, password setting, and client information), and client-server communication (protocol design, request handling, and debugging). Notable features include password protection, item management using a doubly linked list, and multi-client support through threading. The project leverages internet sockets for reliable communication and scalability, enabling future expansion to distributed systems and cloud environments.
