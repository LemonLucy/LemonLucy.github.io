Selected as an exchange student at the University of Putra, Malaysia

<!--more-->
During my exchange semester in Malaysia, I had the opportunity to explore diverse cultures and interact with international students. Although the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in all classes being held online, I took the chance to make the most out of the experience. I actively engaged with other international exchange students living in the dormitory, participating in discussions about society and culture. Despite the online nature of classes, I took advantage of the flexibility and backpacked across Southeast Asia while attending lectures remotely, which allowed me to gain a wealth of unique experiences.I also stayed in guesthouses, where I interacted daily with people from over five different nationalities. These interactions provided an opportunity to improve my English conversation skills and enhance my communication abilities. Through this process, I had the chance to reflect on what I truly wanted to pursue, which ultimately led me to decide to double major in Computer Engineering.
