Selected as an exchange student at the University of Putra, Malaysia

<!--more-->
I went to Germany as an exchange student to explore European and Western cultures further. At the German university, I took two computer science courses, which allowed me to communicate with my classmates and gain insights into the European IT industry. I also backpacked through 15 countries alone, experiencing various cultures. One memorable experience was walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain, where I felt a warm atmosphere of mutual support and encouragement. This journey made me reflect on my life’s values and goals, and I realized that I wanted to positively impact the world, just as others had helped me along the way.
